/**
 * This week I want you to refactor all of your code from the previous weeks.
 * The goal is to have a nice reference for you regarding good javascript practices
 * and perhaps have a repo that you can use to show off your skills.
 * 
 * This includes the following:
 * 
 * 1. Use for loops that are more efficient than the ones you used before 
 *    or use higher order functions where appropriate
 * 2. Exception handle all inputs. Throw errors where appropriate. Use try...catch blocks to handle errors
 * 3. Write new unit tests for all functions to account for errors and edge cases missed in previous tests.
 * 4. Get rid of all console.log statements
 * 5. Make sure you are happy with the variable names you are using
 * 6. Make the code as readable as possible, comment where needed.
 *
